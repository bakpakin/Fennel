# Fennel's Lua API

The `fennel` module provides the following functions for use when
embedding Fennel in a Lua program. If you're writing a pure Fennel
program or working on a system that already has Fennel support, you
probably don't need this.

Any time a function takes an `options` table argument, that table will
usually accept these fields:

* `allowedGlobals`: a sequential table of strings of the names of globals which
  the compiler will allow references to. Set to false to disable checks.
* `correlate`: when this is truthy, Fennel attempts to emit Lua where the line
  numbers match up with the Fennel input code; useful for situation where code
  that isn't under your control will print the stack traces.
* `useMetadata` *(since 0.3.0)*: enables or disables [metadata](#work-with-docstrings-and-metadata),
  allowing use of the doc macro. Intended for development purposes
  (see [performance note](#metadata-performance-note)); defaults to
  true for REPL only.
* `requireAsInclude` *(since 0.3.0)*: Alias any static `require` calls to the `include` special,
  embedding the module code inline in the compiled output. If the module name isn't a string
  literal or resolvable at compile time, falls back to `require` at runtime. Can be used to
  embed both fennel and Lua modules.
* `env`: an environment table in which to run the code; see the Lua manual.
* `compilerEnv`: an environment table in which to run compiler-scoped code
  for macro definitions and `eval-compiler` calls. Internal Fennel functions
  such as `list`, `sym`, etc. will be exposed in addition to this table.
  Defaults to a table containing limited known-safe globals. Pass `_G` to
  disable sandboxing.
* `unfriendly`: disable friendly compiler/parser error messages.

You can pass the string `"_COMPILER"` as the value for `env`; it will
cause the code to be run/compiled in a context which has all
compiler-scoped values available. This can be useful for macro modules
or compiler plugins.

Note that only the `fennel` module is part of the public API. The
other modules (`fennel.utils`, `fennel.compiler`, etc) should be
considered compiler internals subject to change.

## Start a configurable repl

```lua
fennel.repl([options])
```

Takes these additional options:

* `readChunk()`: a function that when called, returns a string of source code.
  The empty is string is used as the end of source marker.
* `pp`: a pretty-printer function to apply on values (default: `fennel.view`).
* `onValues(values)`: a function that will be called on all returned top level values.
* `onError(errType, err, luaSource)`: a function that will be called on each error.
  `errType` is a string with the type of error, can be either, 'parse',
  'compile', 'runtime',  or 'lua'. `err` is the error message, and `luaSource`
  is the source of the generated lua code.

If you don't provide `allowedGlobals` then it defaults to being all
the globals in the environment under which the code will run. Passing
in `false` here will disable global checking entirely.

By default, metadata will be enabled and you can view function signatures and
docstrings with the `doc` macro from the REPL.

## Evaulate a string of Fennel

```lua
local result = fennel.eval(str[, options[, ...]])
```

The `options` table may also contain:

* `filename`: override the filename that Lua thinks the code came from.

Additional arguments beyond `options` are passed to the code and
available as `...`.

## Evaluate a file of Fennel

```lua
local result = fennel.dofile(filename[, options[, ...]])
```

## Use Lua's built-in require function

```lua
table.insert(package.loaders or package.searchers, fennel.searcher)
local mylib = require("mylib") -- will compile and load code in mylib.fnl
```

Normally Lua's `require` function only loads modules written in Lua,
but you can install `fennel.searcher` into `package.searchers` (or in
Lua 5.1 `package.loaders`) to teach it how to load Fennel code.

If you would rather change some of the options you can use
`fennel.makeSearcher(options)` to get a searcher function that's
equivalent to `fennel.searcher` but overrides the default `options`
table.

The `require` function is different from `fennel.dofile` in that it
searches the directories in `fennel.path` for `.fnl` files matching
the module name, and also in that it caches the loaded value to return
on subsequent calls, while `fennel.dofile` will reload each time. The
behavior of `fennel.path` mirrors that of Lua's `package.path`.

If you install Fennel into `package.searchers` then you can use the
3rd-party [lume.hotswap][1] function to reload modules that have been
loaded with `require`.

## Macro Searchers

The compiler sandbox makes it so that the module system is also
isolated from the rest of the system, so the above `require` calls
will not work from inside macros. However, there is a separate
`fennel.macro-searchers` table which can be used to allow different
modules to be loaded inside macros. By default it includes a searcher
to load sandboxed Fennel modules and a searcher to load sandboxed Lua
modules, but if you disable the compiler sandbox you may want to
replace these with searchers which can load arbitrary modules.

The default `fennel.macro-searchers` table also cannot load C modules.
Here's an example of some code which would allow that to work:

```lua
table.insert(fennel["macro-searchers"], function(module_name)
   local filename = fennel["search-module"](module_name, package.cpath)
   if filename then
      local func = "luaopen_" .. module_name
      return function() return package.loadlib(filename, func) end, filename
   end
end)
```

## Get Fennel-aware stack traces.

The `fennel.traceback` function works like Lua's `debug.traceback`
function, except it tracks line numbers from Fennel code correctly.

If you are working on an application written in Fennel, you can
override the default traceback function to replace it with Fennel's:

```lua
debug.traceback = fennel.traceback
```

## Search the path for a module without loading it

```lua
print(fennel.searchModule("my.mod", package.path))
```

If you just want to find the file path that a module would resolve to
without actually loading it, you can use `fennel.searchModule`. The
first argument is the module name, and the second argument is the path
string to search. If none is provided, it defaults to Fennel's own path.

Returns `nil` if the module is not found on the path.

## Compile a string into Lua (can throw errors)

```lua
local lua = fennel.compileString(str[, options])
```

Accepts `indent` as a string in `options` causing output to be
indented using that string, which should contain only whitespace if
provided. Unlike the other functions, the `compile` functions default
to performing no global checks, though you can pass in an `allowedGlobals`
table in `options` to enable it.

Accepts `filename` in `options` as in `fennel.eval`.

## Compile an iterator of bytes into a string of Lua (can throw errors)

```lua
local lua = fennel.compileStream(strm[, options])
```

Accepts `indent` and `filename` in `options` as per above.

## Compile a data structure (AST) into Lua source code (can throw errors)

The code can be loaded via dostring or other methods. Will error on bad input.

```lua
local lua = fennel.compile(ast[, options])
```

Accepts `indent` and `filename` in `options` as per above.

## Get an iterator over the bytes in a string

```lua
local stream = fennel.stringStream(str)
```

## Converts an iterator for strings into an iterator over their bytes

Useful for the REPL or reading files in chunks. This will NOT insert
newlines or other whitespace between chunks, so be careful when using
with io.read().  Returns a second function, clearstream, which will
clear the current buffered chunk when called. Useful for implementing
a repl.

```lua
local bytestream, clearstream = fennel.granulate(chunks)
```

## Converts a stream of bytes to a stream of AST nodes

The `fennel.parser` function returns a stateful iterator function.
It returns true in the first return value if an AST was read, and
returns nil if an end of file was reached without error. Will error
on bad input or unexpected end of source.

```lua
local parse = fennel.parser(strm)
local ok, ast = parse()

-- Or use in a for loop
for ok, ast in parse do
    print(ok, ast)
end
```

The `fennel.parser` function takes two optional arguments; a filename
and a table of options. Supported options are both booleans that
default to false:

* `unfriendly`: disable enhanced parse error reporting
* `comments`: include comment nodes in AST

## AST node definition

The AST returned by the parser consists of data structures
representing the code. Passing AST nodes to the `fennel.view` function
will give you a string which should round-trip thru the parser to give
you the same data back. The same is true with `tostring`, except it
does not work with kv tables.

AST nodes can be any of these types:

### list

A list represents a call to function/macro, or destructuring multiple
return values in a binding context. It's represented as a table which
can be identified using the `fennel.list?` predicate function or
constructed using `fennel.list` which takes any number of arguments
for the contents of the list.

The list also contains these keys indicating where it was defined:
`filename`, `line`, `bytestart`, and `byteend`. This data is used for
stack traces and for pinpointing compiler error messages.

### sequence/kv table

These are table literals in Fennel code produced by square brackets
(sequences) or curly brackets (kv tables). Sequences can be identified
using the `fennel.sequence?` function and constructed using
`fennel.sequence`. There is no predicate or constructor for kv tables;
any table which is not one of the other types is assumed to be one of
these.

At runtime there is no difference between sequences and kv tables
which use monotonically increasing integer keys, but the parser is
able to distinguish between them.

Sequences have their source data in `filename`, `line`, etc keys just
like lists. But kv tables cannot have this, because adding arbitrary
keys to the table would change its contents, so these fields are
instead stored on the metatable. The metatable for kv tables also
includes a `keys` sequence which tells you which order the keys
appeared originally, since kv tables are unordered and there would
otherwise be no way to reconstruct this information.

### symbol

Symbols typically represent identifiers in Fennel code. Symbols can be
identified with `fennel.sym?` and constructed with `fennel.sym` which
takes a string name as its first argument and a source data table as
the second. Symbols are represented as tables which store their source
data in fields on themselves. Unlike the other tables in the AST, they
do not represent collections; they are used as scalar types.

**Note:** `nil` is not a valid AST; code that references nil will have
the symbol named `"nil"` which unfortunately prints in a way that is
visually indistinguishable from actual `nil`.

### vararg

This is a special type of symbol-like construct (`...`) indicating
functions using a variable number of arguments. Its meaning is the
same as in Lua. It's identified with `fennel.varg?` and constructed
with `fennel.varg`.

### number/string/boolean

These are literal types defined by Lua. They cannot carry source data.

### comment

By default, ASTs will omit comments. However, when the `:comment`
field is set in the parser options, comments will be included in the
parsed values. They are identified using `fennel.comment?` and
constructed using the `fennel.comment` function. They are represented
as tables that have source data as fields inside them.

In most data context, comments just get included inline in a list or
sequence. However, in a kv table, this cannot be done, because kv
tables must have balanced key/value pairs, and including comments
inline would imbalance these or cause keys to be considered as values
and vice versa. So the comments are stored on the `comments` field of
metatable instead, keyed by the key or value they were attached to.

## Serialization

The `fennel.view` function takes any Fennel data and turns it into a
representation suitable for feeding back to Fennel's parser. In
addition to tables, strings, numbers, and booleans, it can produce
reasonable output from ASTs that come from the parser. It will emit an
unreadable placeholder for coroutines, functions, and userdata though.

```lua
print(fennel.view({abc=123}[, options])
{:abc 123}
```

## Work with docstrings and metadata

*(Since 0.3.0)*

When running a REPL or using compile/eval with metadata enabled, each function
declared with `fn` or `λ/lambda` will use the created function as a key on
`fennel.metadata` to store the function's arglist and (if provided) docstring.
The metadata table is weakly-referenced by key, so each function's metadata will
be garbage collected along with the function itself.

You can work with the API to view or modify this metadata yourself, or use the `doc`
macro from fennel to view function documentation.

In addition to direct access to the metadata tables, you can use the following methods:

* `fennel.metadata:get(func, key)`: get a value from a function's metadata
* `fennel.metadata:set(func, key, val)`:  set a metadata value
* `fennel.metadata:setall(func, key1, val1, key2, val2, ...)`: set pairs
* `fennel.doc(func, fnName)`: print formatted documentation for function using name.
  Utilized by the `doc` macro, name is whatever symbol you operate on that's bound to
  the function.

```lua
greet = fennel.eval([[
(λ greet [name] "Say hello" (print (string.format "Hello, %s!" name)))
]], {useMetadata = true})

-- fennel.metadata[greet]
-- > {"fnl/docstring" = "Say hello", "fnl/arglist" = ["name"]}

-- works because greet was set globally above for example purposes only
fennel.eval("(doc greet)", { useMetadata = true })
-- > (greet name)
-- >   Say hello

fennel.metadata:set(greet, "fnl/docstring", "Say hello!!!")
fennel.doc(greet, "greet!")
--> (greet! name)
-->   Say hello!!!
```

### Metadata performance note

Enabling metadata in the compiler/eval/REPL will cause every function to store a new
table containing the function's arglist and docstring in the metadata table, weakly
referenced by the function itself as a key.

This may have a performance impact in some applications due to the extra
allocations and garbage collection associated with dynamic function creation.
The impact hasn't been benchmarked, and may be minimal particularly in luajit,
but enabling metadata is currently recommended for development purposes only
to minimize overhead.

## Load Lua code in a portable way

This isn't Fennel-specific, but the `loadCode` function takes a string
of Lua code along with an optional environment table and filename
string, and returns a function for the loaded code which will run inside
that environment, in a way that's portable across any Lua 5.1+ version.

```lua
local f = fennel.loadCode(luaCode, { x = y }, "myfile.lua")
```

## Plugins

Fennel's plugin system is extremely experimental and exposes internals of
the compiler in ways that no other part of the compiler does. It should be
considered unstable; changes to the compiler in future versions are likely
to break plugins, and each plugin should only be assumed to work with
specific versions of the compiler that they're tested against. The
backwards-compatibility guarantees of the rest of Fennel **do not apply** to
plugins.

Compiler plugins allow the functionality of the compiler to be extended in
various ways. A plugin is a module containing various functions in fields
named after different compiler extension points. When the compiler hits an
extension point, it will call each plugin's function for that extension
point, if provided, with various arguments; usually the AST in question and
the scope table. Each plugin function should normally do side effects and
return nil or error out. If a function returns non-nil, it will cause
the rest of the plugins for a given event to be skipped.

* `symbol-to-expression`
* `call`
* `do`
* `fn`
* `destructure`

The `destructure` extension point is different because instead of just
taking `ast` and `scope` it takes a `from` which is the AST for the value
being destructured and a `to` AST which is the AST for the form being
destructured to. This is most commonly a symbol but can be a list or a table.

The `scope` argument is a table containing all the compiler's information
about the current scope. Most of the tables here look up values in their
parent scopes if they do not contain a key.

Plugins can also contain repl commands. If your plugin module has a
field with a name beginning with "repl-command-" then that function
will be available as a comma command from within a repl session. It
will be called with a table for the repl session's environment, a
function which will read the next form from stdin, a function which is
used to print normal values, and one which is used to print errors.

```fennel
(local fennel (require :fennel)
(fn locals [env read on-values on-error scope]
  "Print all locals in repl session scope."
  (on-values [(fennel.view env.___replLocals___)]))

{:repl-command-locals locals}
```

```
$ fennel --plugin locals-plugin.fnl
Welcome to Fennel 0.8.0 on Lua 5.4!
Use ,help to see available commands.
>> (local x 4)
nil
>> (local abc :xyz)
nil
>> ,locals
{
  :abc "xyz"
  :x 4
}
```

The docstring of the function will be used as its summary in the
",help" command listing. Unlike other plugin hook fields, only the
first plugin to provide a repl command will be used.

### Activation

Plugins are activated by passing the `--plugin` argument on the command line,
which should be a path to a Fennel file containing a module that has some of
the functions listed above. If you're using the compiler programmatically,
you can include a `:plugins` table in the `options` table to most compiler
entry point functions.

Your plugin should contain a `:versions` table which contains a list
of strings indicating every version of Fennel which you have tested it
with. You should also have a `:name` field with the plugin's name.
