## 0.10.0 / 2021-08-07

It's Fennel's 5th birthday! We've got the new `accumulate` macro for

The highlight of this release is the table comprehension macros which
take the place of `map` in other lisps. The `&as` clause in
destructuring now allows you to access the original table even as you
destructure it into its fields. The `fennel.view` serializer has been
completely rewritten to improve indentation.

* Allow plugins to provide repl commands
* Label auto-generated locals in Lua output for improved readability
* Add whole-table destructuring with `&as`
* Provide `...` arguments consistently with Lua when requiring modules
* fennelview: respect presence of `__fennelview` metamethod on userdata metatables

* Fix a bug where `import-macros` would not respect certain compiler options

### Changes and Removals
* Warn when using the `&` character in identifiers; will be disallowed later
* Numbers using underscores for readability **may not** begin with an underscore


## 0.7.0 / 2020-11-03

This release adds support for reloading modules in the repl, making
interactive development more streamlined.

### New Features

## 0.6.0 / 2020-09-03

This release introduces the plugin system as well as starting to
sandbox the compiler environment for safer code loading. Nothing is
blocked yet, but it emits warnings when macros use functionality that
is not considered safe; future versions will prevent this.

### New Features
* Add compiler plugin system
* Add `--lua` CLI flag for specifying a custom Lua command/executable
* Expose `list?` and `sym?` in compiler API
