.SH NAME
fennel \- a lisp programming language that runs on Lua
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fennel
[\fB--repl\fR] | 
[\fB--compile \fIfilename\fR] | 
[\fB--eval \fIsource\fR] | 
[\fIfilename\fP] [\fIargs ...\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B fennel
command.
.PP
.B fennel
is the main entry point for Fennel, a lisp programming language that
runs on Lua runtimes. With no options or arguments, it runs an
interactive Read-Eval-Print loop (REPL).
.PP
Given a filename as its first argument, it runs that file and passes
it the subsequent arguments. Ahead-of-time compilation can be invoked
with the
.B --compile
flag.

.SH OPTIONS
A summary of options is included below.
.TP
.B \-\-repl
Start an interactive repl session.
.TP
.B \-\-compile \fIfilename\fP
Perform ahead-of-time compilation on the provided file and write the
Lua output to stdout.
.TP
.B \-\-eval \fIsource\fP
Evaluate a piece of source code and print the result.
.TP
.B \-\-no-searcher
When running a repl or a file,
.B fennel.searcher
is installed by default so that the
.B require
function can load Fennel files in addition to Lua files. This flag
disables that behavior. Has no effect for ahead-of-time compilation.
.TP
.B \-\-indent \fIval\fP
When compiling, use the given string as indentation for the compiler
output. This should consist of whitespace.
.TP
.B \-\-add-package-path \fIpath\fP
Add the given path to
.B package.path
so that the
.B require
function will know to look there when searching for Lua modules.
.TP
.B \-\-add-fennel-path \fIpath\fP
Same as above, but for Fennel's path used when searching for Fennel
modules.
.TP
.B \-\-globals \fIVAR1[,VAR2...]\fP
Allow VAR1, VAR2, etc as globals in addition to the standard set of
globals. This enables strict global checking even in ahead-of-time
compilation where it otherwise would be disabled.
.TP
.B \-\-globals-only \fIVAR1[,VAR2...]\fP
Same as above, but without the addition of the standard set of globals.
.TP
.B \-\-require-as-include
Instead of loading required modules at runtime, compile them inline
into the main file being compiled. Only useful during ahead-of-time
compilation.
.TP
.B \-\-load \fIFILE\fP
Load the specified file before any command is run.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print a help message and exit
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version
Print the version number and exit

.SH DOCUMENTATION

See https://fennel-lang.org for documentation on Fennel. The syntax is
based on the lisp family of languages while the semantics are very
close to Lua, so Lua's reference manual is helpful.
