# Fennel Reference

These are all the special forms recognized by the Fennel compiler. It
does not include built-in Lua functions; see the
[Lua reference manual][1] or the [Lua primer][3] for that.

Remember that Fennel relies completely on Lua for its runtime.
Everything Fennel does happens at compile-time, so you will need to
familiarize yourself with Lua's standard library functions. Thankfully
it's much smaller than almost any other language.

The one exception to this compile-time rule is the `fennel.view`
function which returns a string representation of any Fennel data
suitable for printing.

Fennel source code should be UTF-8-encoded text, although currently
only ASCII forms of whitespace and numerals are supported.

## Functions

### `fn` function

Creates a function which binds the arguments given inside the square
brackets. Will accept any number of arguments; ones in excess of the
declared ones are ignored, and if not enough arguments are supplied to
cover the declared ones, the remaining ones are `nil`.

Example:

```fennel
(fn pxy [x y]
  (print (+ x y)))
```


Giving it a name is optional; if one is provided it will be bound to
it as a local. Even if you don't use it as an anonymous function,
providing a name will cause your stack traces to be more readable, so
it's recommended. Providing a name that's a table field will cause it
to be inserted in a table instead of bound as a local.

### `lambda`/`位` arity-checked function

Creates a function like `fn` does, but throws an error at runtime if
any of the listed arguments are nil, unless its identifier begins with `?`.

Example:

```fennel
(lambda [x ?y z]
  (print (- x (* (or ?y 1) z))))
```

Note that the Lua runtime will fill in missing arguments with nil when
they are not provided by the caller, so an explicit nil argument is no
different than omitting an argument.

The `位` form is an alias for `lambda` and behaves identically.

### Docstrings

*(Since 0.3.0)*

Both the `fn` and `lambda`/`位` forms of function definition accept an optional
docstring.

```fennel
(fn pxy [x y]
  "Print the sum of x and y"
  (print (+ x y)))

(位 pxyz [x ?y z]
  "Print the sum of x, y, and z. If y is not provided, defaults to 0."
  (print (+ x (or ?y 0) z)))
```

These are ignored by default outside of the REPL, unless metadata
is enabled from the CLI (`---metadata`) or compiler options `{useMetadata=true}`,
in which case they are stored in a metadata table along with the arglist,
enabling viewing function docs via the `doc` macro.

```
>> (doc pxy)
(pxy x y)
  Print the sum of x and y
```

All function metadata will be garbage collected along with the function itself.
Docstrings and other metadata can also be accessed via functions on the fennel
API with `fennel.metadata`.

### Hash function literal shorthand

*(Since 0.3.0)*

It's pretty easy to create function literals, but Fennel provides
an even shorter form of functions. Hash functions are anonymous
functions of one form, with implicitly named arguments. All
of the below functions are functionally equivalent.

```fennel
(fn [a b] (+ a b))
```

```fennel
(hashfn (+ $1 $2))
```

```fennel
#(+ $1 $2)
```

This style of anonymous function is useful as a parameter to
higher order functions, such as those provided by Lua libraries
like lume and luafun.

The current implementation only allows for hash functions to use up to
9 arguments, each named `$1` through `$9`, or those with varargs,
delineated by `$...` instead of the usual `...`. A lone `$` in a hash
function is treated as an alias for `$1`.

Hash functions are defined with the `hashfn` macro or special character `#`,
which wraps its single argument in a function literal. For example,

```clojure
#$3               ; same as (fn [x y z] z)
#[$1 $2 $3]       ; same as (fn [a b c] [a b c])
#$                ; same as (fn [x] x) (aka the identity function)
#val              ; same as (fn [] val)
#[:one :two $...] ; same as (fn [...] ["one" "two" ...])
```

Hash arguments can also be used as parts of multisyms. For instance,
`#$.foo` is a function which will return the value of the "foo" key in
its first argument.

### `partial` partial application

Returns a new function which works like its first argument, but fills
the first few arguments in place with the given ones. This is related
to currying but different because calling it will call the underlying
function instead of waiting till it has the "correct" number of args.

Example:

```fennel
(partial (fn [x y] (print (+ x y))) 2)
```

This example returns a function which will print a number that is 2
greater than the argument it is passed.

### `pick-values` emit exactly n values

*(Since 0.4.0)*

Discards all values after the first n when dealing with multi-values (`...`)
and multiple returns. Useful for composing functions that return multiple values
with variadic functions. Expands to a `let` expression that binds and re-emits
exactly n values, e.g.

```fennel
(pick-values 2 (func))
```
expands to
```fennel
(let [(_0_ _1_) (func)] (values _0_ _1_))
```

Example:

```fennel
(pick-values 0 :a :b :c :d :e) ; => nil
[(pick-values 2 (table.unpack [:a :b :c]))] ;-> ["a" "b"]

(fn add [x y ...] (let [sum (+ (or x 0) (or y 0))]
                        (if (= (select :# ...) 0) sum (add sum ...))))

(add (pick-values 2 10 10 10 10)) ; => 20
(->> [1 2 3 4 5] (table.unpack) (pick-values 3) (add)) ; => 6
```

**Note:** If n is greater than the number of values supplied, n values will still be emitted.
This is reflected when using `(select "#" ...)` to count varargs, but tables `[...]`
ignore trailing nils:

```fennel
(select :# (pick-values 5 "one" "two")) ; => 5
[(pick-values 5 "one" "two")]           ; => ["one" "two"]
```

### `pick-args` create a function of fixed arity

*(Since 0.4.0, deprecated 0.10.0)*

Like `pick-values`, but takes an integer `n` and a function/operator
`f`, and creates a new function that applies exactly `n` arguments to `f`.

Example, using the `add` function created above:

```
(pick-args 2 add) ; expands to `(fn [_0_ _1_] (add _0_ _1_))`
(-> [1 2 3 4 5] (table.unpack) ((pick-args 3 add))) ; => 6

(local count-args (partial select "#"))
((pick-args 3 count-args) "still three args, but 2nd and 3rd are nil") ; => 3
```

## Binding

### `let` scoped locals

Introduces a new scope in which a given set of local bindings are used.

Example:

```fennel
(let [x 89]
  (print (+ x 12)) ; => 101
```

These locals cannot be changed with `set` but they can be shadowed by
an inner `let` or `local`. Outside the body of the `let`, the bindings
it introduces are no longer visible.

Any time you bind a local, you can destructure it if the value is a
table or a function call which returns multiple values:

Example:

```fennel
(let [(x y z) (unpack [10 9 8])]
  (+ x y z)) ; => 27
```

Example:

```fennel
(let [[a b c] [1 2 3]]
  (+ a b c)) ; => 6
```

If a table key is a string with the same name as the local you want to
bind to, you can use shorthand of just `:` for the key name followed
by the local name.

Example:

```fennel
(let [{:msg message : val} {:msg "hello there" :val 19}]
  (print message)
  val) ; prints "hello there" and returns 19
```

When destructuring a sequential table, you can capture all the remainder
of the table in a local by using `&`:

Example:

```fennel
(let [[a b & c] [1 2 3 4 5 6]]
  (table.concat c ",")) ; => "3,4,5,6"
```

When destructuring a non-sequential table, you can capture the
original table along with the destructuring by using `&as`:

Example:

```fennel
(let [{:a a :b b &as all} {:a 1 :b 2 :c 3 :d 4}]
  (+ a b all.c all.d)) ; => 10
```

### `with-open` bind and auto-close file handles

*(Since 0.4.2)*

While Lua will automatically close an open file handle when it's garbage collected,
GC may not run right away; `with-open` ensures handles are closed immediately, error
or no, without boilerplate.

The usage is similar to `let`, except:
- destructuring is disallowed (symbols only on the left-hand side)
- every binding should be a file handle or other value with a `:close` method.

After executing the body, or upon encountering an error, `with-open`
will invoke `(value:close)` on every bound variable before returning the results.

The body is implicitly wrapped in a function and run with `xpcall` so that all bound
handles are closed before it re-raises the error.

Example:

```fennel
;; Basic usage
(with-open [fout (io.open :output.txt :w) fin (io.open :input.txt)]
  (fout:write "Here is some text!\n")
  ((fin:lines))) ; => first line of input.txt

;; This demonstrates that the file will also be closed upon error.
(var fh nil)
(local (ok err)
  (pcall #(with-open [file (io.open :test.txt :w)]
            (set fh file) ; you would normally never do this
            (error :whoops!))))
(io.type fh) ; => "closed file"
[ok err]     ; => [false "<error message and stacktrace>"]
```

### `local` declare local

Introduces a new local inside an existing scope. Similar to `let` but
without a body argument. Recommended for use at the top-level of a
file for locals which will be used throughout the file.

Example:

```fennel
(local tau-approx 6.28318)
```

Supports destructuring and multiple-value binding.

### `match` pattern matching

*(Since 0.2.0)*

Evaluates its first argument, then searches thru the subsequent
pattern/body clauses to find one where the pattern matches the value,
and evaluates the corresponding body. Pattern matching can be thought
of as a combination of destructuring and conditionals.

**Note**: Lua also has "patterns" which are matched against strings
similar to how regular expressions work in other languages; these are
two distinct concepts with similar names.

Example:

```fennel
(match mytable
  59      :will-never-match-hopefully
  [9 q 5] (print :q q)
  [1 a b] (+ a b))
```

In the example above, we have a `mytable` value followed by three
pattern/body clauses. The first clause will only match if `mytable`
is 59. The second clause will match if `mytable` is a table with 9 as
its first element and 5 as its third element; if it matches, then it
evaluates `(print :q q)` with `q` bound to the second element of
`mytable`. The final clause will only match if `mytable` has 1 as its
first element; if so then it will add up the second and third elements.

Patterns can be tables, literal values, or symbols. If a symbol is
already in scope, then the value is checked against the existing
value, but if it's a new local then the symbol is bound to the value.
The `_` pattern is treated as a wildcard that always matches.

Tables can be nested, and they may be either sequential (`[]` style)
or key/value (`{}` style) tables. Sequential tables will match if they
have at least as many elements as the pattern. (To allow an element to
be nil, use a symbol like `?this`.) Tables will never fail to match
due to having too many elements. You can use `&` to  capture all the
remaining elements of a sequential table, just like `let`.

```fennel
(match mytable
  {:subtable [a b ?c] :depth depth} (* b depth)
  _ :unknown)
```

You can also match against multiple return values using
parentheses. (These cannot be nested, but they can contain tables.)
This can be useful for error checking.

```fennel
(match (io.open "/some/file")
  (nil msg) (report-error msg)
  f (read-file f))
```

Pattern matching performs unification, meaning that if `x` has an
existing binding, clauses which attempt to bind it to a different
value will not match:

```fennel
(let [x 95]
 (match [52 85 95]
   [b a a] :no ; because a=85 and a=95
   [x y z] :no ; because x=95 and x=52
   [a b x] :yes)) ; a and b are fresh values while x=95 and x=95
```

There is a special case for `_`; it is never bound and always acts as
a wildcard. If no clause matches, it returns nil.

Sometimes you need to match on something more general than a structure
or specific value. In these cases you can use guard clauses:

```fennel
(match [91 12 53]
  (where [a b c] (= 5 a)) :will-not-match
  (where [a b c] (= 0 (math.fmod (+ a b c) 2)) (= 91 a)) c) ; -> 53
```

In this case the pattern should be wrapped in parentheses (like when
matching against multiple values) but the first thing in the
parentheses is the `where` symbol. Each form after the pattern is a
condition; all the conditions must evaluate to true for that pattern
to match.

If several patterns share the same body and guards, such patterns can
be combined with `or` special in the `where` clause:

```fennel
(match [5 1 2]
  (where (or [a 3 9] [a 1 2]) (= 5 a)) "Will match either [5 3 9] or [5 1 2]"
  _ "will match anything else")
```

This is essentially equivalent to:

```fennel
(match [5 1 2]
  (where [a 3 9] (= 5 a)) "Will match either [5 3 9] or [5 1 2]"
  (where [a 1 2] (= 5 a)) "Will match either [5 3 9] or [5 1 2]"
  _ "will match anything else")
```

However, patterns which bind variables, should not be combined with
`or` if different variables are bound in different patterns or some
variables are missing:

``` fennel
;; bad
(match [1 2 3]
  ;; Will throw an error because `b' is nil for the first
  ;; pattern but the guard still uses it.
  (where (or [a 1 2] [a b 3]) (> a 0) (> b 1))
  :body)

;; ok
(match [1 2 3]
  (where (or [a b 2] [a b 3]) (> a 0) (>= b 1))
  :body)
```

**Note:** The `match` macro can be used in place of the `if-let` macro
from Clojure. The reason Fennel doesn't have `if-let` is that `match`
makes it redundant.

**Note 2:** Prior to Fennel 0.8.2 the `match` macro used infix `?`
operator to test patterns against the guards. While this syntax is
still supported, `where` should be preferred instead:

``` fennel
(match [1 2 3]
  (where [a 2 3] (> a 0)) "new guard syntax"
  ([a 2 3] ? (> a 0)) "obsolete guard syntax")
```

### `global` set global variable

Sets a global variable to a new value. Note that there is no
distinction between introducing a new global and changing the value of
an existing one. This supports destructuring and multiple-value binding.

Example:

```fennel
(global prettyprint (fn [x] (print (fennel.view x))))
```

Note that every global is also exposed on the `_G` table, which can
often be a better choice than using `global`.

### `var` declare local variable

Introduces a new local inside an existing scope which may have its
value changed. Identical to `local` apart from allowing `set` to work
on it.

Example:

```fennel
(var x 83)
```


Supports destructuring and multiple-value binding.

### `set` set local variable or table field

Changes the value of a variable introduced with `var`. Will not work
on globals or `let`/`local`-bound locals. Can also be used to change a
field of a table, even if the table is bound with `let` or `local`,
provided the field is given at compile-time.

Example:

```fennel
(set x (+ x 91))
```


Example:

```fennel
(let [t {:a 4 :b 8}]
  (set t.a 2) t) ; => {:a 2 :b 8}
```


Supports destructuring and multiple-value binding.

### `tset` set table field

Sets the field of a given table to a new value. The field name does not
need to be known at compile-time. Works on any table, even those bound
with `local` and `let`.

Example:

```fennel
(let [tbl {:d 32} field :d]
  (tset tbl field 19) tbl) ; => {:d 19}
```


You can provide multiple successive field names to perform nested sets.

### multiple value binding

In any of the above contexts where you can make a new binding, you
can use multiple value binding. Otherwise you will only capture the first
value.

Example:

```fennel
(let [x (values 1 2 3)]
  x) ; => 1
```

Example:

```fennel
(let [(file-handle message code) (io.open "foo.blah")]
  message) ; => "foo.blah: No such file or directory"
```

Example:

```fennel
(global (x-m x-e) (math.frexp 21)), {:m x-m :e m-e} ;  => {:e 5 :m 0.65625}
```

Example:

```fennel
(do (local (_ _ z) (unpack [:a :b :c :d :e])) z)  => c
```

## Flow Control

### `if` conditional

Checks a condition and evaluates a corresponding body. Accepts any
number of condition/body pairs; if an odd number of arguments is
given, the last value is treated as a catch-all "else". Similar to
`cond` in other lisps.

Example:

```fennel
(let [x (math.random 64)]
  (if (= 0 (% x 10))
      "multiple of ten"
      (= 0 (% x 2))
      "even"
      "I dunno, something else"))
```

All values other than nil or false are treated as true.

### `when` single side-effecting conditional

Takes a single condition and evaluates the rest as a body if it's not
nil or false. This is intended for side-effects.

Example:

```fennel
(when launch-missiles?
  (power-on)
  (open-doors)
  (fire))
```

### `each` general iteration

Runs the body once for each value provided by the iterator. Commonly
used with `ipairs` (for sequential tables) or `pairs` (for any table
in undefined order) but can be used with any iterator.

Example:

```fennel
(each [key value (pairs mytbl)]
  (print key (f value)))
```

Any loop can be terminated early by placing an `:until` clause at the
end of the bindings:

```fennel
(local out [])
(each [_ value (pairs tbl) :until (< max-len (length out))]
  (table.insert out value))
```

Most iterators return two values, but `each` will bind any number. See
[Programming in Lua][4] for details about how iterators work.

### `for` numeric loop

Counts a number from a start to stop point (inclusive), evaluating the
body once for each value. Accepts an optional step.

Example:

```fennel
(for [i 1 10 2]
  (print i))
```

This example will print all odd numbers under ten.

Like `each`, loops using `for` can also be terminated early with an
`:until` clause. The clause is checked before each iteration of the
body; if it is true at the beginning then the body will not run at all.

```fennel
(var x 0)
(for [i 1 128 :until (maxed-out? x)]
  (set x (+ x i)))
```

### `while` good old while loop

Loops over a body until a condition is met. Uses a native Lua `while`
loop, so this can be faster than recursion.

Example:

```fennel
(var done? false)
(while (not done?)
  (print :not-done)
  (when (> (math.random) 0.95)
    (set done? true)))
```

### `do` evaluate multiple forms returning last value

Accepts any number of forms and evaluates all of them in order,
returning the last value. This is used for inserting side-effects into
a form which accepts only a single value, such as in a body of an `if`
when multiple clauses make it so you can't use `when`. Some lisps call
this `begin` or `progn`.

```fennel
(if launch-missiles?
    (do
      (power-on)
      (open-doors)
      (fire))
    false-alarm?
    (promote lt-petrov))
```

## Data

### operators

* `and`, `or`, `not`: boolean
* `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `^`: arithmetic
* `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `=`, `not=`: comparison
* `lshift`, `rshift`, `band`, `bor`, `bxor`, `bnot`: bitwise operations

These all work as you would expect, with a few caveats. The bitwise operators
are only availible in Lua 5.3+, unless you use the `--use-bit-lib` flag or
the `useBitLib` flag in the options table, which lets them be used in
LuaJIT. The integer division operator (`//`) is only availible in Lua 5.3+.

They all take any number of arguments, as long as that number is fixed
at compile-time. For instance, `(= 2 2 (unpack [2 5]))` will evaluate
to `true` because the compile-time number of values being compared is 3.

Note that these are all special forms which cannot be used as
higher-order functions.

### `..` string concatenation

Concatenates its arguments into one string. Will coerce numbers into
strings, but not other types.

Example:

```fennel
(.. "Hello" " " "world" 7 "!!!") ; => "Hello world7!!!"
```


### `length` string or table length

*(Changed in 0.3.0: the function was called `#` before.)*

Returns the length of a string or table. Note that the length of a
table with gaps (nils) in it is undefined; it can return a number
corresponding to any of the table's "boundary" positions between nil
and non-nil values. If a table has nils and you want to know the last
consecutive numeric index starting at 1, you must calculate it
yourself with `ipairs`; if you want to know the maximum numeric key in
a table with nils, you can use `table.maxn`.

Example:

```fennel
(+ (length [1 2 3 nil 8]) (length "abc")) ; => 6 or 8
```


### `.` table lookup

Looks up a given key in a table. Multiple arguments will perform
nested lookup.

Example:

```fennel
(. mytbl myfield)
```


Example:

```fennel
(let [t {:a [2 3 4]}] (. t :a 2)) ; => 3
```


Note that if the field name is a string known at compile time, you
don't need this and can just use `mytbl.field`.

### Nil-safe `?.` table lookup

Looks up a given key in a table. Multiple arguments will perform
nested lookup. If any of subsequent keys is not present, will
short-circuit to `nil`.

Example:

```fennel
(?. mytbl myfield)
```


Example:

```fennel
(let [t {:a [2 3 4]}] (?. t :a 4 :b)) ; => nil
(let [t {:a [2 3 4 {:b 42}]}] (?. t :a 4 :b)) ; => 42
```

### `collect`, `icollect` table comprehension macros

*(Since 0.8.0)*

The `collect` macro takes a "iterator binding table" in the format
that `each` takes, and an expression that produces key-value pairs,
and runs through the iterator, filling a new table with the key-value
pairs produced by the expression. The expression must produce 2
values, or nil.

```fennel
(collect [k v (pairs {:apple "red" :orange "orange"})]
  (values (.. "color-" v) k))
;; -> {:color-orange "orange" :color-red "apple"}

;; equivalent to:
(let [tbl {}]
  (each [k v (pairs {:apple "red" :orange "orange"})]
    (match (values (.. "color-" v) k)
      (key value) (tset tbl key value)))
  tbl)
```

The `icollect` macro is almost identical, except that the
expression returns one value and the new table is filled sequentially
to produce a sequential table. Adding a `when` condition around the
expression can act effectively as a filter, since inserting a nil
value into a table is a no-op.

```fennel
(icollect [_ v (ipairs [1 2 3 4 5 6])]
  (when (> v 2) (* v v)))
;; -> [9 16 25 36]

;; equivalent to:
(let [tbl []]
  (each [_ v (ipairs [1 2 3 4 5 6])]
    (tset tbl (+ (length tbl) 1) (when (> v 2) (* v v))))
  tbl)
```

Like `each` and `for`, the table comprehensions support an `:until`
clause for early termination.

### `accumulate` iterator accumulation

*(Since 0.10.0)*

Runs through an iterator and performs accumulation, similar to `fold`
and `reduce` commonly used in functional programming languages.
Like `collect` and `icollect`, it takes an iterator binding table
and an expression as its arguments. The difference is that in
`accumulate`, the first two items in the binding table are used as
an "accumulator" variable and its initial value.
For each iteration step, it evaluates the given expression and
the returned value becomes the next accumulator variable.
`accumulate` returns the final value of the accumulator variable.

Example:

```fennel
(accumulate [avg 0
             i n (ipairs [1 2 3 4])]
  (let [/i (/ i)]
    (+ (* avg (- 1 /i)) (* n /i))))
;; -> 2.5
```

The `:until` clause is also supported here for early termination.

### `values` multi-valued return

Returns multiple values from a function. Usually used to signal
failure by returning nil followed by a message.

Example:

```fennel
(fn [filename]
  (if (valid-file-name? filename)
      (open-file filename)
      (values nil (.. "Invalid filename: " filename))))
```

## Other

### `:` method call

Looks up a function in a table and calls it with the table as its
first argument. This is a common idiom in many Lua APIs, including
some built-in ones.

*(Since 0.3.0)* Just like Lua, you can perform a method call by calling a function
name where `:` separates the table variable and method name.

Example:

```fennel
(let [f (assert (io.open "hello" "w"))]
  (f:write "world")
  (f:close))
```

If the name of the method isn't known at compile time, you can use `:`
followed by the table and then the method's name as a string.

Example:

```fennel
(let [f (assert (io.open "hello" "w"))
      method1 :write
      method2 :close]
  (: f method1 "world")
  (: f method2))
```

Both of these examples are equivalent to the following:

```fennel
(let [f (assert (io.open "hello" "w"))]
  (f.write f "world")
  (f.close f))
```

### `->`, `->>`, `-?>` and `-?>>` threading macros

The `->` macro takes its first value and splices it into the second
form as the first argument. The result of evaluating the second form
gets spliced into the first argument of the third form, and so on.

Example:

```fennel
(-> 52
    (+ 91 2) ; (+ 52 91 2)
    (- 8)    ; (- (+ 52 91 2) 8)
    (print "is the answer")) ; (print (- (+ 52 91 2) 8) "is the answer")
```

The `->>` macro works the same, except it splices it into the last
position of each form instead of the first.

`-?>` and `-?>>`, the thread maybe macros, are similar to `->` & `->>`
but they also do checking after the evaluation of each threaded
form. If the result is false or nil then the threading stops and the result
is returned. `-?>` splices the threaded value as the first argument,
like `->`, and `-?>>` splices it into the last position, like `->>`.

This example shows how to use them to avoid accidentally indexing a
nil value:

```fennel
(-?> {:a {:b {:c 42}}}
     (. :a)
     (. :missing)
     (. :c)) ; -> nil
(-?>> :a
      (. {:a :b})
      (. {:b :missing})
      (. {:c 42})) ; -> nil
```

While `->` and `->>` pass multiple values thru without any trouble,
the checks in `-?>` and `-?>>` prevent the same from happening there
without performance overhead, so these pipelines are limited to a
single value.

> concurrency; they are named after the thread which is used in

### `doto`

Similarly, the `doto` macro splices the first value into subsequent
forms. However, it keeps the same value and continually splices the
same thing in rather than using the value from the previous form for
the next form.

```fennel
(doto (io.open "/tmp/err.log")
  (: :write contents)
  (: :close))

;; equivalent to:
(let [x (io.open "/tmp/err.log")]
  (: x :write contents)
  (: x :close)
  x)
```

The first form becomes the return value for the whole expression, and
subsequent forms are evaluated solely for side-effects.

### `include`

*(since 0.3.0)*

```fennel
(include :my.embedded.module)
```

Loads Fennel/Lua module code at compile time and embeds it in the
compiled output. The module name must resolve to a string literal
during compilation.  The bundled code will be wrapped in a function
invocation in the emitted Lua and set on
`package.preload[modulename]`; a normal `require` is then emitted
where `include` was used to load it on demand as a normal module.

In most cases it's better to use `require` in your code and use the
`requireAsInclude` option in the API documentation and the
`--require-as-include` CLI flag (`fennel --help`) to accomplish this.

The `require` function is not part of Fennel; it comes from
Lua. However, it works to load Fennel code. See the [Modules and
multiple files](tutorial#modules-and-multiple-files) section in the
tutorial and [Programming in Lua][5] for details about `require`.

Starting from version 0.10.0 `include` and hence
`--require-as-include` support semi-dynamic compile-time resolution of
module paths similarly to `import-macros`.  See the [relative
require](tutorial#relative-require) section in the tutorial for more
information.

## Macros

All forms which introduce macros do so inside the current scope. This
is usually the top level for a given file, but you can introduce
macros into smaller scopes as well. Note that macros are a
compile-time construct; they do not exist at runtime. As such macros
cannot be exported at the bottom of a module like functions and other values.

### `import-macros` load macros from a separate module

*(Since 0.4.0)*

Loads a module at compile-time and binds its functions as local macros.

A macro module exports any number of functions which take code forms
as arguments at compile time and emit lists which are fed back into
the compiler as code. The module calling `import-macros` gets whatever
functions have been exported to use as macros. For instance, here is a
macro module which implements `when2` in terms of `if` and `do`:

```fennel
(fn when2 [condition body1 ...]
  (assert body1 "expected body")
  `(if ,condition
     (do ,body1 ,...)))

{:when2 when2}
```

A full explanation of how macros work is out of scope for this document,
but you can think of it as a compile-time template function. The backtick
on the third line creates a template for the code emitted by the macro. The
`,` serves as "unquote" which splices values into the template. *(Changed
in 0.3.0: `@` was used instead of `,` before.)*

Assuming the code above is in the file "my-macros.fnl" then it turns this input:

```fennel
(import-macros {: when2} :my-macros)

(when2 (= 3 (+ 2 a))
  (print "yes")
  (finish-calculation))
```

and transforms it into this code at compile time by splicing the arguments
into the backtick template:

```fennel
(if (= 3 (+ 2 a))
  (do
    (print "yes")
    (finish-calculation)))
```

The `import-macros` macro can take any number of binding/module-name
pairs. It can also bind the entire macro module to a single name
rather than destructuring it. In this case you can use a dot to call
the individual macros inside the module:

```fennel
(import-macros mine :my-macros)

(mine.when2 (= 3 (+ 2 a))
  (print "yes")
  (finish-calculation))
```

Note that all macro code runs at compile time, which happens before
runtime. Locals which are in scope at runtime are not visible during
compile-time. So this code will not work:

```fennel
(local (module-name file-name) ...)
(import-macros mymacros (.. module-name ".macros"))
```

However, this code will work, provided the module in question exists:

```fennel
(import-macros mymacros (.. ... ".macros"))
```

See "Compiler API" below for details about additional functions visible
inside compiler scope which macros run in.

### `require-macros` load macros with less flexibility

The `require-macros` form is like `import-macros`, except it does not
give you any control over the naming of the macros being
imported. It is strongly recommended to use `import-macros` instead.

### Macro module searching

By default, Fennel will search for macro modules similarly to how it
searches for normal runtime modules: by walking thru entries on
`fennel.macro-path` and checking the filesystem for matches. However,
in some cases this might not be suitable, for instance if your Fennel
program is packaged in some kind of archive file and the modules do
not exist as distinct files on disk.

To support this case you can add your own searcher function to the
`fennel.macro-searchers` table. For example, assuming `find-in-archive`
is a function which can look up strings from the archive given a path:

```fennel
(local fennel (require :fennel))

(fn my-searcher [module-name]
  (let [filename (.. "src/" module-name ".fnl")]
    (match (find-in-archive filename)
      code (values (partial fennel.eval code {:env :_COMPILER})
                   filename))))

(table.insert fennel.macro-searchers my-searcher)
```

The searcher function should take a module name as a string and return
two values if it can find the macro module: a loader function which will
return the macro table when called, and an optional filename. The
loader function will receive the module name and the filename as arguments.

### `macros` define several macros

*(Since 0.3.0)*

Defines a table of macros. Note that inside the macro definitions, you
cannot access variables and bindings from the surrounding code. The
macros are essentially compiled in their own compiler
environment. Again, see the "Compiler API" section for more details
about the functions available here.

```fennel
(macros {:my-max (fn [x y]
                   `(let [x# ,x y# ,y]
                      (if (< x# y#) y# x#)))})

(print (my-max 10 20))
(print (my-max 20 10))
(print (my-max 20 20))
```

### `macro` define a single macro

```fennel
(macro my-max [x y]
  `(let [x# ,x y# ,y]
     (if (< x# y#) y# x#)))
```

If you are only defining a single macro, this is equivalent to the
previous example. The syntax mimics `fn`.

### `macrodebug` print the expansion of a macro

```fennel
(macrodebug (-> abc
                (+ 99)
                (> 0)
                (when (os.exit))))
; -> (if (> (+ abc 99) 0) (do (os.exit)))
```

Call the `macrodebug` macro with a form and it will repeatedly expand
top-level macros in that form and print out the resulting form. Note
that the resulting form will usually not be sensibly indented, so you
might need to copy it and reformat it into something more readable.

Note that this prints at compile-time since `macrodebug` is a macro.

### Macro gotchas

It's easy to make macros which accidentally evaluate their arguments
more than once. This is fine if they are passed literal values, but if
they are passed a form which has side-effects, the result will be unexpected:

```fennel
(var v 1)
(macros {:my-max (fn [x y]
                   `(if (< ,x ,y) ,y ,x))})

(fn f [] (set v (+ v 1)) v)

(print (my-max (f) 2)) ; -> 3 since (f) is called twice in the macro body above
```

*(Since 0.3.0)* In order to prevent [accidental symbol capture][2], you may not bind a
bare symbol inside a backtick as an identifier. Appending a `#` on
the end of the identifier name as above invokes "auto gensym" which
guarantees the local name is unique.

```fennel
(macros {:my-max (fn [x y]
                   `(let [x2 ,x y2 ,y]
                      (if (< x2 y2) y2 x2)))})

(print (my-max 10 20))
; Compile error in 'x2' unknown:?: macro tried to bind x2 without gensym; try x2# instead
```

`macros` is useful for one-off, quick macros, or even some more complicated
macros, but be careful. It may be tempting to try and use some function
you have previously defined,  but if you need such functionality, you
should probably use `import-macros`.

For example, this will not compile in strict mode! Even when it does
allow the macro to be called, it will fail trying to call a global
`my-fn` when the code is run:

```fennel
(fn my-fn [] (print "hi!"))

(macros {:my-max (fn [x y]
                   (my-fn)
                   `(let [x# ,x y# ,y]
                      (if (< x# y#) y# x#)))})
; Compile error in 'my-max': attempt to call global '__fnl_global__my_2dfn' (a nil value)
```

### `eval-compiler`

Evaluate a block of code during compile-time with access to compiler
scope. This gives you a superset of the features you can get with
macros, but you should use macros if you can.

Example:

```fennel
(eval-compiler
  (each [name (pairs _G)]
    (print name)))
```

This prints all the functions available in compiler scope.

### Compiler Environment

Inside `eval-compiler`, `macros`, or `macro` blocks, as well as
`import-macros` modules, these functions are visible to your code.

As of 0.6.0 the compiler will warn you if you try to use globals outside a
certain predetermined safe list in a macro; this will turn into an error in a
future version of Fennel. You can disable this warning by providing the
command-line argument `--no-compiler-sandbox` or by passing `{:compiler-env
_G}` in the options table when invoking the compiler programmatically.

Please note that the sandbox is not suitable to be used as a robust
security mechanism.  It has not been audited and should not be relied
upon to protect you from running untrusted code.

Note that lists are compile-time concepts that don't exist at runtime; they
are implemented as tables which have a special metatable to distinguish them
from regular tables defined with square or curly brackets. Similarly symbols
are tables with a string entry for their name and a marker metatable. You
can use `tostring` to get the name of a symbol.

* `list` - return a list, which is a special kind of table used for code.
* `sym` - turn a string into a symbol.
* `gensym` - generates a unique symbol for use in macros, accepts an optional prefix string.
* `list?` - is the argument a list? Returns the argument or `false`.
* `sym?` - is the argument a symbol? Returns the argument or `false`.
* `table?` - is the argument a non-list table? Returns the argument or `false`.
* `sequence?` - is the argument a non-list _sequential_ table (created
                with `[]`, as opposed to `{}`)? Returns the argument or `false`.
* `varg?` - is this a `...` symbol which indicates var args? Returns a special
            table describing the type or `false`.
* `multi-sym?` - a multi-sym is a dotted symbol which refers to a table's
                 field. Returns a table containing each separate symbol, or
                 `false`.
* `view` - `fennel.view` table serializer.

* `assert-compile` - works like `assert` but takes a list/symbol as its third
  argument in order to provide pinpointed error messages.

These functions can be used from within macros only, not from any
`eval-compiler` call:

* `in-scope?` - does the symbol refer to an in-scope local? Returns the symbol or `nil`.
* `macroexpand` - performs macroexpansion on its argument form; returns an AST.

Note that other internals of the compiler exposed in compiler scope are
subject to change.

## `lua` Escape Hatch

There are some cases when you need to emit Lua output from Fennel in
ways that don't match Fennel's semantics. For instance, if you are
porting an algorithm from Lua that uses early returns, you may want
to do the port as literally as possible first, and then come back to
it later to make it idiomatic. You can use the `lua` special form to
accomplish this:

```fennel
(fn find [tbl pred]
  (each [key val (pairs tbl)]
    (when (pred val)
      (lua "return key"))))
```

Lua code inside the string can refer to locals which are in scope;
however note that it must refer to the names after mangling has been
done, because the identifiers must be valid Lua. The Fennel compiler
will emit `foo-bar` as `foo_bar` in the Lua output in order for it to
be valid. When in doubt, inspect the compiler output to see what it
looks like.

Normally in these cases you would want to emit a statement, in which
case you would pass a string of Lua code as the first argument. But
you can also use it to emit an expression if you pass in a string as
the second argument.

Note that this should only be used in exceptional circumstances, and
if you are able to avoid it, you should.
