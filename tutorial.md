# Getting Started with Fennel

A programming language is made up of **syntax** and **semantics**. The
semantics of Fennel vary only in small ways from Lua (all noted
below). The syntax of Fennel comes from the lisp family of
languages. Lisps have syntax which is very uniform and predictable,
which makes it easier to [write code that operates on code][1] as well as
[structured editing][2].

If you know Lua and a lisp already, you'll feel right at home in Fennel. Even
if not, Lua is one of the simplest programming languages in existence, so if
you've programmed before you should be able to pick it up without too much
trouble, especially if you've used another dynamic imperative language with
closures. The [Lua reference manual][3] is a fine place to look for details,
but Fennel's own [Lua Primer][14] is shorter and covers the highlights.

## OK, so how do you do things?

### Functions and lambdas

Use `fn` to make functions. If you provide an optional name, the
function will be bound to that name in local scope; otherwise it is
simply an anonymous value. The argument list is provided in square
brackets. The final value is returned.

(If you've never used a lisp before, the main thing to note is that
the function or macro being called goes *inside* the parens, not
outside.)

```fennel
(fn print-and-add [a b c]
  (print a)
  (+ b c))
```

Functions can take an optional docstring in the form of a string that
immediately follows the arglist. Under normal compilation, this
is removed from the emitted Lua, but in the REPL, or when compiling with
metadata enabled (`fennel --metadata <tgt-files>`), the docstring and
function usage can be viewed with the `doc` macro:

*Note: Enabling metadata is only recommended for development purposes.*

```fennel
(fn print-sep [sep ...]
  "Prints args as a string, delimited by sep"
  (print (table.concat [...] sep)))
(doc print-sep) ; -> outputs:
;; (print-sep sep ...)
;;   Prints args as a string, delimited by sep
```

Like other lisps, Fennel uses semicolons for comments.

Functions defined with `fn` are fast; they have no runtime overhead
compared to Lua. However, they also have no arity checking. (That is,
calling a function with the wrong number of arguments does not cause
an error.) For safer code you can use `lambda` which ensures you will
get at least as many arguments as you define, unless you signify that
one may be omitted by beginning its name with a `?`:

```fennel
(lambda print-calculation [x ?y z] (print (- x (* (or ?y 1) z))))
(print-calculation 5) ; -> error: Missing argument z
```

Note that the second argument `?y` is allowed to be `nil`, but `z` is not:

```fennel
(print-calculation 5 nil 3) ; -> 2
```

Like `fn`, lambdas accept an optional docstring after the arglist.

### Locals and variables

Locals are introduced using `let` with the names and values wrapped in
a single set of square brackets:

```fennel
(let [x (+ 89 5.2)
      f (fn [abc] (print (* 2 abc)))]
  (f x))
```

Here `x` is bound to the result of adding 89 and 5.2, while `f` is
bound to a function that prints twice its argument. These bindings are
only valid inside the body of the `let` call.

You can also introduce locals with `local`, which is nice when they'll
be used across the whole file, but in general `let` is preferred because
it's clearer at a glance where the value is used:

```fennel
(local tau-approx 6.28318)
```

Locals set this way cannot be given new values, but you *can*
introduce new locals that shadow the outer names:

```fennel
(let [x 19]
  ;; (set x 88) <- not allowed!
  (let [x 88]
    (print (+ x 2))) ; -> 90
  (print x)) ; -> 19
```

If you need to change the value of a local, you can use `var` which
works like `local` except it allows `set` to work on it. There is no
nested `let`-like equivalent of `var`.

```fennel
(var x 19)
(set x (+ x 8))
(print x) ; -> 27
```

### Numbers and strings

Of course, all our standard arithmetic operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`
work here in prefix form. Note that numbers are double-precision floats in all
Lua versions prior to 5.3, which optionally introduced integers. On 5.3 and
up, integer division uses `//` and bitwise operations use `lshift`, `rshift`,
`bor`, `band`, `bnot` and `xor`. Bitwise operators and integer division will
not work if the host Lua environment is older than version 5.3.

You may also use underscores to separate sections of long numbers. The
underscores have no effect on the output.

```fennel
(let [x (+ 1 99)
      y (- x 12)
      z 100_000]
  (+ z (/ y 10)))
```

Strings are essentially immutable byte arrays. UTF-8 support is
provided from a [3rd-party library][4]. Strings are concatenated with `..`:

```fennel
(.. "hello" " world")
```

### Tables

In Lua (and thus in Fennel), tables are the only data structure. The
main syntax for tables uses curly braces with key/value pairs in them:

```fennel
{"key" value
 "number" 531
 "f" (fn [x] (+ x 2))}
```

You can use `.` to get values out of tables:

```fennel
(let [tbl (function-which-returns-a-table)
      key "a certain key"]
  (. tbl key))
```

And `tset` to put them in:

```fennel
(let [tbl {}
      key1 "a long string"
      key2 12]
  (tset tbl key1 "the first value")
  (tset tbl key2 "the second one")
  tbl) ; -> {"a long string" "the first value" 12 "the second one"}
```

Immutable tables are not native to Lua, though it's possible to
construct immutable tables using metatables with some performance overhead.

### Sequential Tables

Some tables are used to store data that's used sequentially; the keys
in this case are just numbers starting with 1 and going up. Fennel
provides alternate syntax for these tables with square brackets:

```fennel
["abc" "def" "xyz"] ; equivalent to {1 "abc" 2 "def" 3 "xyz"}
```

Lua's built-in `table.insert` function is meant to be used with sequential
tables; all values after the inserted value are shifted up by one index:
If you don't provide an index to `table.insert` it will append to the end
of the table.

The `table.remove` function works similarly; it takes a table and an index
(which defaults to the end of the table) and removes the value at that
index, returning it.

```fennel
(local ltrs ["a" "b" "c" "d"])

(table.remove ltrs)       ; Removes "d"
(table.remove ltrs 1)     ; Removes "a"
(table.insert ltrs "d")   ; Appends "d"
(table.insert ltrs 1 "a") ; Prepends "a"

(. ltrs 2)                ; -> "b"
;; ltrs is back to its original value ["a" "b" "c" "d"]
```

The `length` form returns the length of sequential tables and strings:

```fennel
(let [tbl ["abc" "def" "xyz"]]
  (+ (length tbl)
     (length (. tbl 1)))) ; -> 6
```

Note that the length of a table with gaps in it is undefined; it can
return a number corresponding to any of the table's "boundary"
positions between nil and non-nil values.

Lua's standard library is very small, and thus several functions you
might expect to be included, such `map`, `reduce`, and `filter` are
absent. It's recommended to pull in a 3rd-party library like [Lume][5]
or [luafun][9] for those.

### Iteration

Looping over table elements is done with `each` and an iterator like
`pairs` (used for general tables) or `ipairs` (for sequential tables):

```fennel
(each [key value (pairs {"key1" 52 "key2" 99})]
  (print key value))

(each [index value (ipairs ["abc" "def" "xyz"])]
  (print index value))
```

Note that whether a table is sequential or not is not an inherent
property of the table but depends on which iterator is used with it.
You can call `ipairs` on any table, and it will only iterate
over numeric keys starting with 1 until it hits a `nil`.

You can use any [Lua iterator][6] with `each`, but these are the most
common. Here's an example that walks through [matches in a string][7]:

```fennel
(var sum 0)
(each [digits (string.gmatch "244 127 163" "%d+")]
  (set sum (+ sum (tonumber digits))))
```

The other iteration construct is `for` which iterates numerically from
the provided start value to the inclusive finish value:

```fennel
(for [i 1 10]
  (print i))
```

You can specify an optional step value; this loop will only print odd
numbers under ten:

```fennel
(for [i 1 10 2]
  (print i))
```

### Looping

If you need to loop but don't know how many times, you can use `while`:

```fennel
(while (keep-looping?)
  (do-something))
```

### Conditionals

Finally we have conditionals. The `if` form in Fennel can be used the
same way as in other lisp languages, but it can also be used as `cond`
for multiple conditions compiling into `elseif` branches:

```fennel
(let [x (math.random 64)]
  (if (= 0 (% x 2))
      "even"
      (= 0 (% x 10))
      "multiple of ten"
      "I dunno, something else"))
```

Being a lisp, Fennel has no statements, so `if` returns a value as an
expression. Lua programmers will be glad to know there is no need to
construct precarious chains of `and`/`or` just to get a value!

The other conditional is `when`, which is used for an arbitrary number
of side-effects and has no else clause:

```fennel
(when (currently-raining?)
  (wear "boots")
  (deploy-umbrella))
```

## Back to tables just for a bit

Strings that don't have spaces in them can use the `:shorthand` syntax
instead, which is often used for table keys:

```fennel
{:key value :number 531}
```

If a table has string keys like this, you can pull values out of it
easily with a dot if the keys are known up front:

```fennel
(let [tbl {:x 52 :y 91}]
  (+ tbl.x tbl.y)) ; -> 143
```

You can also use this syntax with `set`:

```fennel
(let [tbl {}]
  (set tbl.one 1)
  (set tbl.two 2)
  tbl) ; -> {:one 1 :two 2}
```

If a table key has the same name as the variable you're setting it to,
you can omit the key name and use `:` instead:

```fennel
(let [one 1 two 2
      tbl {: one : two}]
  tbl) ; -> {:one 1 :two 2}
```

Finally, `let` can destructure a table into multiple locals.

There is positional destructuring:

```fennel
(let [data [1 2 3]
      [fst snd thrd] data]
  (print fst snd thrd)) ; -> 1       2       3
```

And destructuring of tables via key:

```fennel
(let [pos {:x 23 :y 42}
      {:x x-pos :y y-pos} pos]
  (print x-pos y-pos)) ; -> 23      42
```

As above, if a table key has the same name as the variable you're
destructuring it to, you can omit the key name and use `:` instead:

```fennel
(let [pos {:x 23 :y 42}
      {: x : y} pos]
  (print x y)) ; -> 23      42
```

This can nest and mix and match:

```fennel
(let [f (fn [] ["abc" "def" {:x "xyz" :y "abc"}])
      [a d {:x x : y}] (f)]
  (print a d)
  (print x y))
```

If the size of the table doesn't match the number of binding locals,
missing values are filled with `nil` and extra values are discarded.
Note that unlike many languages, `nil` in Lua actually represents the
absence of a value, and thus tables cannot contain `nil`. It is an
error to try to use `nil` as a key, and using `nil` as a value removes
whatever entry was at that key before.

## Error handling

Error handling in Lua has two forms. Functions in Lua can return any
number of values, and most functions which can fail will indicate
failure by using two return values: `nil` followed by a failure
message string. You can interact with this style of function in Fennel
by destructuring with parens instead of square brackets:

```fennel
(let [(f msg) (io.open "file" "rb")]
  ;; when io.open succeeds, f will be a file, but if it fails f will be
  ;; nil and msg will be the failure string
  (if f
      (do (use-file-contents (f.read f "*all"))
          (f.close f))
      (print (.. "Could not open file: " msg))))
```

You can write your own function which returns multiple values with `values`:

```fennel
(fn use-file [filename]
  (if (valid-file-name? filename)
      (open-file filename)
      (values nil (.. "Invalid filename: " filename))))
```

If you detect a serious error that needs to be signaled beyond just
the calling function, you can use `error` for that. This will
terminate the whole process unless it's within a protected call,
similar to the way throwing an exception works in many languages. You
can make a protected call with `pcall`:

```fennel
(let [(ok? val-or-msg) (pcall potentially-disastrous-call filename)]
  (if ok?
      (print "Got value" val-or-msg)
      (print "Could not get value:" val-or-msg)))
```

The `pcall` invocation there means you are running
`(potentially-disastrous-call filename)` in protected mode. `pcall` takes
an arbitrary number of arguments which are passed on to the
function. You can see that `pcall` returns a boolean (`ok?` here) to
let you know if the call succeeded or not, and a second value
(`val-or-msg`) which is the actual value if it succeeded or an error
message if it didn't.

**Note**: In real-world code it's better to use `match` when handling
  errors; these snippets are intended as examples to specifically
  illustrate how multiple values work.

The `assert` function takes a value and an error message; it calls
`error` if the value is `nil` and returns it otherwise. This can be
used to turn multiple-value failures into errors (kind of the inverse
of `pcall` which turns `error`s into multiple-value failures):

```fennel
(let [f (assert (io.open filename))
      contents (f.read f "*all")]
  (f.close f)
  contents)
```

In this example because `io.open` returns `nil` and an error message
upon failure, a failure will trigger an `error` and halt execution.

## Variadic Functions

Fennel supports variadic functions like most modern languages. The syntax for
taking a variable number of arguments to a function is the `...` symbol, which
must be the last parameter to a function. This syntax is inherited from Lua rather
than Lisp.

The `...` form is not a list or first class value, it expands to multiple values
inline.  To access individual elements of the vararg, first wrap it in a table
literal (`[...]`) and index like a normal table, or use the `select` function
from Lua's core library. Often, the vararg can be passed directly to another
function such as `print` without needing to bind it to a single table.

```fennel
(fn print-each [...]
 (each [i v (ipairs [...])]
  (print (.. "Argument " i " is " v))))

(print-each :a :b :c)
```

```fennel
(fn myprint [prefix ...]
 (io.write prefix)
 (io.write (.. (select "#" ...) " arguments given: "))
 (print ...))

(myprint ":D " :d :e :f)
```

Varargs are scoped differently than other variables as well - they are only
accessible to the function in which they are created. This means that the
following code wil NOT work, as the varargs in the inner function are out of
scope.

```fennel
(fn badcode [...]
 (fn []
  (print ...)))
```

You can read [more detailed coverage of some of the problems with `...` and multiple values](https://benaiah.me/posts/everything-you-didnt-want-to-know-about-lua-multivals/)
here.

## Globals

Globals are set with `global`. Good code doesn't use too many of
these, but they can be nice for debugging in some contexts. Note that
unlike most forms, with `global` there is no distinction between
creating a new global and giving an existing global a new
value.

```fennel
(global add (fn [x y] (+ x y)))
(add 32 12) ; -> 44
```

Unless you are doing ahead-of-time compilation, Fennel will track all
known globals and prevent you from refering to unknown globals, which
prevents a common source of bugs in Lua where typos go undetected.

If you get an error that says `unknown global in strict mode` it means that
you're trying compile code that uses a global which the Fennel compiler doesn't
know about. Most of the time, this is due to a coding mistake. However, in some
cases you may get this error with a legitimate global reference. If this
happens, it may be due to a bug in the compiler, or it may be an inherent
limitation of Fennel's strategy. You can use `_G.myglobal` to refer to it in a
way that works around this check.

## Gotchas

There are a few surprises that might bite seasoned lispers. Most of
these result necessarily from Fennel's insistence upon imposing zero
runtime overhead over Lua.

* The arithmetic and comparison operators are not first-class functions
  They can behave in surprising ways with multiple-return-valued functions,
  because the number of arguments to them must be known at compile-time.

* There is no `apply` function; use `unpack` (or `table.unpack`
  depending on your Lua version) instead: `(f 1 3 (unpack [4 9])`.

* Tables are compared for identity, not based on the value of their
  contents, as per [Baker][8].

* Return values in the default repl will get pretty-printed, but
  calling `(print tbl)` will emit output like `table: 0x55a3a8749ef0`.
  If you don't already have one, it's recommended for debugging to
  define a printer function which calls `fennelview` on its argument
  before printing it: `(local view (require :fennelview))
  (global pp (fn [x] (print (view x))))`

* Lua programmers should note Fennel functions cannot do early returns.

## Other stuff just works

Note that built-in functions in [Lua's standard library][10] like `math.random`
above can be called with no fuss and no overhead.

This includes features like coroutines, which are usually implemented
using special syntax in other languages. Coroutines
[let you express non-blocking operations without callbacks][11].

Tables in Lua may seem a bit limited, but [metatables][12] allow a great deal
more flexibility. All the features of metatables are accessible from Fennel
code just the same as they would be from Lua.

## Modules and multiple files

You can use the `require` function to load code from Lua files.

```fennel
(let [lume (require :lume)
      tbl [52 99 412 654]
      plus (fn [x y] (+ x y))]
  (lume.map tbl (partial plus 2))) ; -> [54 101 414 656]
```

Modules in Lua are simply tables which contain functions and other values.
The last value in a Fennel file will be used as the value of the
module. (Technically this can be any value, not just a table.)

By default, modules are looked up by looking thru all the directories on
`package.path`. To require a module that's in a subdirectory, take the file
name, replace the slashes with dots, and remove the extension, then pass
that to `require`. For instance, a file called `lib/ui/menu.lua` would be
read when loading the module `lib.ui.menu`.

Out of the box `require` doesn't work with Fennel files, but you can
add an entry to Lua's `package.searchers` (`package.loaders` in Lua 5.1)
to support it:

```lua
local fennel = require "fennel"
table.insert(package.loaders or package.searchers, fennel.searcher)
local mylib = require("mylib") -- will compile and load code in mylib.fnl
```

Or if you're doing it from Fennel code:

```fennel
(local fennel (require :fennel))
(table.insert (or package.loaders package.searchers) fennel.searcher)
(local mylib (require :mylib))
```

Once you add this, `require` will work on Fennel files just like it
does with Lua; for instance `(require :mylib.parser)` will look in
"mylib/parser.fnl" on Fennel's search path (stored in `fennel.path`
which is distinct from `package.path` used to find Lua modules). The
path usually includes an entry to let you load things relative to the
current directory by default.

## Embedding

Lua is most commonly used to embed inside other applications, and
Fennel is no different. The simplest thing to do is include Fennel the
output from `fennel --compile` as part of your overall application's
build process. However, the Fennel compiler is very small, and
including it into your codebase means that you can embed a Fennel repl
inside your application or support reloading from disk, allowing a
much more pleasant interactive development cycle.

Here is an example of embedding the Fennel compiler inside a
[LÖVE][13] game written in Lua to allow live reloads:

```lua
local fennel = require("fennel")
-- mycode.fnl ends in a line like this:
-- {:draw (fn [] ...) :update (fn [dt] ...)}
local mycode = fennel.dofile("mycode.fnl")

love.update = function(dt)
  mycode.update(dt)
  -- other updates
end

love.draw = function()
  mycode.draw()
  -- other drawing
end

love.keypressed = function(key)
  if(key == "f5") then -- support reloading
    for k,v in pairs(fennel.dofile("mycode.fnl")) do
      mycode[k] = v
    end
  else
    -- other key handling
  end
end

```

You can add `fennel.lua` as a single file to your project, but if you also
add `fennelview.fnl` then when you use a Fennel repl you'll get results
rendered much more nicely. Running `(local view (require :fennelview))`
will get you a `view` function which turns any table into a fennel-syntax
string rendering of that table for debugging.
